## Multiple Booleans for State
Developers commonly use many boolean-type states to define the component's state. This increases complexity and makes the code difficult to maintain as the number of states and typing increases. In the example shown, the component has some ``useState`` of boolean type, which can be replaced with better typing alternatives.

```tsx
function Component() {
    const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
    const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
    const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);
    // ...
}
```
