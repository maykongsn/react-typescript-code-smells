## Any Type
TypeScript allows type checking and type inference for variables, objects, functions, etc. By defining the type ``any`` for an element in the code, the developer is disabling type checking, allowing manipulation of these entities without any verification. For example, consider the code below, where a state has its type defined as ``any``. This is problematic because it nullifies the benefits that TypeScript offers in terms of type safety and compile-time error detection. Consequently, without the check, runtime errors may occur.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState<any>(null);

  // ...
};

export default MyComponent;
```
